### What's your advice to someone who wants to start being a trader?

Don't.  You'll lose it all 99.9% of the time.

If you really badly want to trade risk for gains, then (after buying spot 100%)
buy long dated futures on very low leverage.

### Why should I invest in BTC, I can't get enough gains?  Please recommend an alt.

BTC is one of the best investments in the crypto space because the risk is the lowest.
When you buy a shitcoin, you can lose it all.  Most likely you are buying a shitcoin based on the recommendation of someone else who may not be able to tell opportunities from scams.
